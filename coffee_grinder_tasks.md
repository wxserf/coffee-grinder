# Coffee Grinder - Development Task Outline

## **Phase 1: Foundation Verification (Priority: Critical)**

### Task 1.1: Source File Extraction & Verification
- [ ] Extract CSS from `ecg69.html` → `src/styles/main.css`
- [ ] Extract JavaScript from `ecg69.html` → `src/scripts/main.js` 
- [ ] Extract Web Worker code → `src/scripts/worker.js`
- [ ] Create `src/index.html` with external references
- [ ] Test modularized version matches original functionality

### Task 1.2: Build System Testing
- [ ] Verify `build.js` correctly inlines CSS and JavaScript
- [ ] Test Web Worker blob creation in build output
- [ ] Ensure built version is identical to original `ecg69.html`
- [ ] Test all export formats (PDF, Markdown, Text)

### Task 1.3: Development Environment Setup
- [ ] Test `npm run dev` local server functionality
- [ ] Verify hot reload workflow for development
- [ ] Test build → serve → distribution workflow
- [ ] Create development vs. production environment documentation

## **Phase 2: Code Quality & Structure (Priority: High)**

### Task 2.1: Code Organization
- [ ] Split `main.js` into logical modules:
  - `ui.js` - UI interactions and DOM manipulation
  - `validation.js` - JSON validation and error handling
  - `export.js` - PDF, Markdown, and text generation
  - `storage.js` - localStorage management
- [ ] Create configuration file for constants and settings
- [ ] Implement proper error handling throughout codebase

### Task 2.2: Testing Implementation
- [ ] Create unit tests for core functions
- [ ] Add integration tests for blueprint processing
- [ ] Test error scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Implement automated testing in build pipeline

### Task 2.3: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Analyze and optimize Web Worker performance
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for large blueprints
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long operations
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for large JSON files

## **Phase 3: Feature Enhancement (Priority: Medium)**

### Task 3.1: User Experience Improvements
- [ ] Implement PWA capabilities (service worker, manifest)
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle functionality
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for power users

### Task 3.2: Template System Development
- [ ] Create template library for common automation patterns
- [ ] Implement template selection interface
- [ ] Add custom template creation functionality
- [ ] Build template sharing/import system

### Task 3.3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add Make.com blueprint direct import
- [ ] Implement advanced schema validation
- [ ] Create version history tracking
- [ ] Add collaborative features (sharing, comments)

## **Phase 4: Integration & Distribution (Priority: Low)**

### Task 4.1: Platform Integration
- [ ] Research Make.com API integration possibilities
- [ ] Explore Zapier workflow import capabilities
- [ ] Investigate other automation platform integrations
- [ ] Create plugin architecture for extensibility

### Task 4.2: Distribution & Deployment
- [ ] Set up GitHub Pages deployment
- [ ] Create automated release pipeline
- [ ] Implement version tagging and changelog generation
- [ ] Build distribution packages for different use cases

### Task 4.3: Documentation & Community
- [ ] Create comprehensive developer documentation
- [ ] Build user guide with tutorials
- [ ] Set up contribution guidelines
- [ ] Create issue templates and PR guidelines

## **Immediate Next Steps (This Week)**

1. **Extract and modularize source files** from `ecg69.html`
2. **Test build pipeline** to ensure output matches original
3. **Verify all functionality** works in modularized version
4. **Create development branch** for ongoing work
5. **Set up basic testing structure**

## **Success Metrics**

- [ ] Modularized version 100% functionally identical to original
- [ ] Build process creates single-file distribution
- [ ] Development workflow supports rapid iteration
- [ ] All export formats working correctly
- [ ] No regression in performance or features

## **Risk Mitigation**

- **Backup**: Keep original `ecg69.html` as reference and fallback
- **Testing**: Extensive testing at each phase before proceeding
- **Documentation**: Document all changes and decisions
- **Version Control**: Use feature branches for major changes
